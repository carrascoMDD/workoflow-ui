# workOflow : flowable-ionic4angular6-inbox01

**workOflow Single-page-application and hybrid Android/iOS app playground with Ionic3 Angular6 on  Flowable REST API as Spring Boot Java application.**

Note that the outer package 
https://github.com/carrascoMDD/flowable-ionic4angular6-inbox01
has been produced to have local installs of cordova and ionic to avoid breaking this or other ionic apps upon any update of global install (it's known to happen).
