# workOflow : workoflow-ui

**Single-Page-Application and hybrid Android/iOS app with Ionic3/Angular6 over Flowable REST API/Spring Boot/Java in local ionic & cordova.**

Note that the outer package 
https://github.com/carrascoMDD/workoflow-ui
has been produced to have local installs of cordova and ionic to avoid breaking this or other ionic apps upon any update of global install (it's known to happen).
